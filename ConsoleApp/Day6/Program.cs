/* Object-Oriented Programing
 * Test your knowledge
 * Q1: public: allow access to all
 *     private: allow access to only this class
 *     protected: allow access to this and inherited classes
 *     internal: allow access within this assembly
 *     protected internal: allow access to this assembly and any
 *                      class inherited this class
 *     private protected: allow access to classes derived from this class, 
 *                      but only within its containing assembly
 * Q2: static declares a member of a type, rather that its instance
 *      and is shared on all instances
 *     const declares a constant field of an instance that is set at compile time
 *     readonly declares a field with its value set once during declaration
 *      of an instance
 * Q3: A constructor helps instantiate a class instance
 * Q4: partial is useful to split up code allowing better management
 * Q5: A tuple is a reference data type that holds a pair of value
 * Q6: The "record" keyword is used to defined an immutable class
 * Q7: Overloading is to have the same function names with different
 *      inputs/ouputs.
 *     Overriding is to override a method that previously implemented
 *      with the same inputs and outputs.
 * Q8: A field is a variable of a class that simply holds value of data
 *     A property encapsulated a field with getter/setter methods to further
 *      manage the field's access.
 * Q9: Make a parameter optional by putting the parameter at the end
 *      of the parameter list and setting the default value for it.
 * Q10: An interface depicts the behavior of it's inheritance.
 *      An abstract class depicts the behavior and also the characteristic of
 *          its inheritance.
 * Q11: Public
 * Q12: True
 * Q13: True
 * Q14: False
 * Q15: False
 * Q16: False
 * Q17: True
 * Q18: True
 * Q19: False
